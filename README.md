### how to run

```bash
$ git clone
```

1. go to your folder
2. open "host.bat" if on Windows, "host.command" if on Mac
3. look in resulting console window and check if it contains a message beginning with "Serving HTTP on ..."— if not, you may not have Python installed; go download and install first.
4. now you're hosting a fake server— keep the window open.
5. open your web browser (preferably Google Chrome) and navigate to http://localhost:8000/ (assuming the console window's message said port 8000, if not, change the number in the URL to match.
6. observe!
